# Calculating the amount of soil before after the dredging work

This project aims to calculate the dredging area for the design section and dredged area from postwork in a river/canal after dredging work is done.

# Data Description

The file named 'data' contains the elevation of a river along its cross-section before and after the dredging work.
The file 'bedwidth_corrected' contains parameters of design dredging cross-sections.

# Project Description

In this project, the amount of soil dredged is calculated and then compared to the amount within the design section. <br>
Calculating the soil volume from the surveyed data can be a lengthy and complicated process. The elevation along the river cross-section is surveyed before and after the dredging work is done. Because of sedimentation, some parts of the river cross-section can have higher elevations even after dredging. Some differences in the prework and postwork cross-section result from minor mistakes during the manual surveying or slight natural shifting of sediments. These factors are taken into consideration here.
